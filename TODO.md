# TODO

## README

* Add a "comprehensive overview of the project's goal, motivation and structure"

## user_input

* Remove match-case from `user_input()` if it really needs to be compatible with Python 3.7

## data_scraping

* Add dynamic waiting in `get_damage_dealt()` and `get_healing_done()` for consistency, too make sure the correct table is actually loaded before downloading it
* Maaaaaaybe add an option for Chromium Webdriver

## data_visualization

* `parse_colors()` could probably be done in a more compact way (not really important)
